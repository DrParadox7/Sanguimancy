Version 1.1.7-Pre4:
Waila compatibility added. Woo :D.
A couple of fixes to existing blocks to make them work properly with Waila ^_^.
Added a Corrupted Demon Shard (no texture yet), along with a new mechanic: Corruption Infusion.
More information on Corruption Infusion will come later, but it's basically a crafting mechanic.
Some maven stuff in the build.gradle.
Changed the type of damage done by the Drill of the Dead to PlayerDamage if ThaumicTinkerer isn't installed. Sorry for its users!

Version 1.1.7-Pre3:
More tweaks, a model and a texture.

Version 1.1.7-Pre2:
Tweaks here and there are done. It should be totally working, if you ignore the fact that it has no recipe.

Version 1.1.7-Pre1:
Started working on a way to manage Soul Corruption. It's mostly working, but still needs a few tweaks here and there.

Version 1.1.6:
A couple of ritual changes.

Version 1.1.5:
New BU api, and changed the category registry to go with the api changes.

Version 1.1.4:
Shipping the BloodUtils api.
Added entries to BloodUtils' ingame manual, the Blood Tome.

Version 1.1.3:
Added a new ritual, the Timberman. It obviously cuts trees >.>.
Updated to the new Blood Magic Beta, and made it so that activating the Drill of the Dead added some Soul Corruption.
Added a new ritual, the Filler. It places blocks in a 5x1x5 area around the master ritual stone.

Version 1.1.2:
Some refractoring for the itemblocks.
Removal of test code in the Player Sacrificer, that IS important. Update as soon as possible.

Version 1.1.1:
Fixed issues with the rendering of the Illusion Blocks.
Fixed putting in a stack of Sacrificing Stones when right clicking the Sacrifice Transferrer. Only 1 gets placed now.
Added a new check to the SoulCorruptionHelper.

Version 1.1.0:
Added the textures for the Soul Corruption stuff. Also added a utils class, so that I can easily access itemstacks.

Version 1.1.0-Pre4:
The worst Soul Corruption effect removes a bit of corruption every time it happens. That is to say, a 1/5000 chance.
Added a new effect, illusion.

Version 1.1.0-Pre3:
Added more effects to the Soul Corruption mechanic, both positive and negative ones.

Version 1.1.0-Pre2:
Added a new Soul Corruption mechanic. It doesn't do much at the moment, but it's implemented, and fully working. COME TO ME IDEAS!

Version 1.1.0-Pre1:
Added a	 new mechanic, the Player sacrifice. This allows a player to take all the LP from another player's Soul Network, and transfer it to his own. More details will come later.
