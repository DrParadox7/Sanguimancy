This is present to give credit to the one who deserves it.
Wasliebob made the whole GUI Api.
This package here is just some copy pasting of his code, and a couple of modifications so that the code fitted what I wanted it to do.
So, here you go: All credit for this goes to Wasliebob, and thanks again for letting me butcher your work.
