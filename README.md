#About this branch
This branch is here to group the stuff that I coded during my Christmas holidays on my laptop.
Sadly, said laptop isn't able to run MC well, and I'm even less able to test my code well.
So, this branch has almost totally untested stuff, and works on what should "theoretically" work. Yea, that stuff that never happens. Ever.
If you wish to test things for me, and fix any issues you might find, go for it! Pull Requests are your greatest friends.
